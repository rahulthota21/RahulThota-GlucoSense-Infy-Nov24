# GlucoSense: AI-Powered Diabetes Detection for Early Intervention

## Overview
GlucoSense is an AI-powered project designed to aid in the early detection of diabetes. By analyzing patient data, this project aims to provide a robust, machine-learning-based solution for healthcare professionals to identify potential diabetes cases efficiently.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand data trends and visualize distributions.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Build and evaluate models to predict diabetes accurately.
- **Visualization:** Leverage visual tools to interpret results effectively.

## Workflow
1. **Import Libraries:** Set up the development environment with required libraries.
2. **Load Dataset:** Import and inspect the dataset for quality and structure.
3. **EDA:** Identify patterns and relationships in the data.
4. **Preprocessing:** Prepare the data for model training.
5. **Model Training:** Develop and train a machine learning model.
6. **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using standard metrics.
7. **Visualization:** Present the outcomes using charts and graphs.
8. 
## Requirements
- Python 3.11/3.12
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, xgboost

## Outputs
- EDA Insights: Visualizations and relationships between features.
- Model Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Scores for all models.
- Final Model: Optimal classifier for diabetes prediction.
