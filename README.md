# Project_Diabetes: Predicting Diabetes Status using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

**Project_Diabetes** aims to develop a machine learning model to predict diabetes status based on healthcare data. The primary objective is to understand the relationship between lifestyle factors and diabetes risk. This project will utilize various machine learning techniques for data analysis, feature selection, model development, and evaluation.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data discrepancies, and outlier management.
- **Feature Engineering**: Identifying key features and relationships within the data to enhance model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing and evaluating various algorithms, including classification models, to predict diabetes risk.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Precision, recall, F1 score, AUC, and classification accuracy.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you’ll need to set up the necessary environment and dependencies. The following instructions will help you run the code on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.5
- Required Python libraries (listed below)

### Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahulthota21/RahulThota-GlucoSense-Infy-Nov24.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd RahulThota-GlucoSense-Infy-Nov24
3. **Install dependencies:**
   It’s recommended to create a virtual environment before installing the dependencies.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the code:**
   Once the environment is set up, you can start by running the main.py file or explore individual scripts for data preprocessing, feature selection, and model building.
   ```bash
   python main.py


## Usage

After setting up the environment and installing dependencies, you can use this project to predict diabetes status. The repository includes scripts for:

- **Data Preprocessing**: `preprocessing.py`
- **Feature Selection**: `feature_selection.py`
- **Model Building and Training**: `model_building.py`
- **Model Evaluation**: `model_evaluation.py`

You can execute each of these scripts to follow through the project steps or modify them as needed for your own research or applications.
